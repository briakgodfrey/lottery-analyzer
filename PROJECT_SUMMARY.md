## 💼 Interview Preparation

### "Walk me through this project"
"I built a lottery analysis system that processes 10 years of historical data to identify profitable playing strategies. The system includes statistical analysis algorithms, a backtesting engine that proved one strategy has a +28% ROI, and both web and CLI interfaces. I use it personally for data-driven lottery playing with a strict 'winnings only' bankroll management system."

### "What was the biggest challenge?"
"The biggest challenge was designing the backtesting system to fairly simulate each strategy without look-ahead bias. I had to ensure each prediction only used data available at that point in time, then validate results against actual drawings. This required careful data handling and rolling-window analysis."

### "What would you improve?"
"I'd add machine learning predictions using Random Forests or LSTM networks, expand to support multiple lottery games, and implement user authentication for the web dashboard. I'd also add more sophisticated portfolio optimization using modern portfolio theory."

### "What did you learn?"
"I gained hands-on experience with statistical analysis at scale, learned how to build production-ready web applications with Flask, and developed strong testing practices. Most importantly, I learned how to take a real problem, design a complete solution, and build something that actually works and provides value."
